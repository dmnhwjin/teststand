How to set up your git repo: 

Go online onto your GitHub account, and create new repository. There, you'll be given the following code to: 

echo "# reponame" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/CEngelbrecht/test.git
git push -u origin master

Four stages of adding to a git repo: 

1. Make local changes to the code in the text editor.
2. 'git add filename' to put the changed file into the staging area 
3. 'git commit -m HereIsTheCommitMessage' to (LOCALLY!!!!) commit the changes you've made to your code
4. 'git push origin master' to push your changes that you've commited locally onto your online repository. You'll know 
if you've made this push correctly because you'll be asked for your username and password
